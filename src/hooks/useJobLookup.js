/**
 * Shared job_number -> Job Book record lookup.
 *
 * Tracker and Legacy both guess job/film/client info from raw Wrike data
 * (folder tree-climbing, title parsing) — fragile by nature. The `jobs`
 * table is the authoritative, admin-curated source once a job has been
 * seen: any correction made in Management > Job Book should be trusted
 * over a fresh Wrike guess everywhere else.
 *
 * This hook also self-populates `jobs` the first time a job number is
 * encountered, so Job Book fills in from real usage instead of requiring
 * manual entry, while never overwriting a row that's already there.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — the lookup is keyed on the XY CODE (e.g. "XY025716"), not the
 * full "Film Title : XY025716, Description" string. A single job surfaces in
 * three inconsistent shapes: the admin panel writes the full canonical string,
 * a curated book row carries the full string, but a raw Wrike timelog carries
 * only the bare code. Keying on the code lets a bare-code pull inherit the
 * curated film/client from a full-string Job Book row (and vice versa), and
 * stops the same job being registered twice under two different keys.

// Legacy and the Tracker has to group on exactly the same key, and a second
// copy of this rule would be free to drift from the one the lookup uses.

// When two rows collapse onto the same code (e.g. a curated full-string row and
// a leftover bare-code auto-registration), keep the richer one: a filled
// film_title/client and the canonical "Film : CODE, Desc" form each count.
